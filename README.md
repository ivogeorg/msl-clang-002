# C Programming Assignment 2 (IN PROGRESS)

_red-black trees in C_

* * * 

_note: cmocka has to be built separately and dynamically linked to the project_

_note: the CMakeLists.txt has a hardcoded library name and location assuming an Ubuntu installation_


**TODO:** Publish OVA. Update _CMakeLists.txt_ to work regardless of platform.


* * *

## Goals

1. Practice development in the C programming language.
2. Imiplement a self-balancing red-black tree with O(n) space requirement and O(log n) search, instert, and delete operations.
3. Learn to program against an API requirement.
4. Learn to work with a test suite.
5. Prepare for [C3](https://github.com/ivogeorg/msl-clang-003).
6. Develop good coding style.

## Synopsis

This assignment is a continuation of [C PA 1](https://github.com/ivogeorg/msl-clang-001), and adds the extra requirement for _logarithmic_ search, insert, and delete operations. While a simple binary tree can perform these operations in _O(n)_ time, a _red-black tree_ can perform them in _O(log n)_. The RB tree is a self-balancing tree and is guaranteed to be approximately balanced such that _no simple path between a root and a leaf is more than twice as long as any other_. As in the previous assignment, you need to read in a file with English words and output a file where the words are counted and sorted. In this assignment, the files will contain 1000s of words, so an unbalanced tree will be unfeasible.

## Submission

You need to fork this repository and `git clone` it to your development environment. When you are done and your code works, `git commit` all your changes and `git push` to your forked (aka **remote**) repository. Work in the **master** branch. This assignment will have a test suite, for which you will need an installation of the [cmocka](https://cmocka.org/) testing framework for C. Your will need to pass the tests in the test suite.

### Github
Submissions are **one** per team. Submit with your team account. _**Reminder:** The team account name should look like **ucd-[course]-[team-color]-s18**. For example, **ucd-os-orange-s18**._ 

### Canvas
Both team members have to make an assignment submission on [Canvas](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1270192) before the deadline. You only need to enter the _clone URL_ of your project repository (e.g. https://github.com/ivogeorg/msl-clang-002.git).

## Grading

Each team mate gets the number of points the team submission scored.

### Points
Maximum: 100

### Details
The fraction of tests you pass will be multiplied by the maximum number.

### Bonus 1
Maximum: 100 additional points, to be applied to your overall score before final grade calculation

Order the tree according to the dynamic count of words in the file rather than in alphabetical order. Print the words in descending order of incidence. _Warning: This might take a long time._

See [Detailed instructions](#detailed-instructions) for more information.

### Bonus 2
Maximum: 200 additional points, to be applied to your overall score before final grade calculation

Implement the _join_ operation on two trees.

See [Detailed instructions](#detailed-instructions) for more information.

## Due date

The assignment is due on **Thu, Feb 1, at 23:59 Mountain time**. The last commit to your repository before the deadline will be evaluated.

## Honor code

Free Github repositories are public so you can look at each other's code. Please, don't do that. You can discuss any programming topics and the assignments in general but sharing of solutions diminishes the individual learning experience of many people. Assignments might be randomly checked for plagiarism and a plagiarism claim may be raised against you. You definitely don't want that.

**Note:** There are many implementations of red-black trees _online_. (See [Resources](#resources).) Do not copy-paste. You can look at other implementations, but you have to _type your own code_. The first quiz _after_ the assignment will contain questions on red-black trees, so you need to understand them.

## Resources

1. RB trees [explained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree) on Wikipedia.
2. RB trees [implemented](http://adtinfo.org/libavl.html/Red_002dBlack-Trees.html) in Ben Pfaff's [GNU libavl](http://adtinfo.org/index.html). _Note: Includes extensive explanations, figures, and links to the standard textbooks on the subject. Ben Pfaff is the author of [Pintos](http://pintos-os.org/)._
3. RB trees [visualized](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RedBlack.html) at University of San Francisco's [Data Structure Visualizations](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html). 
4. The CLRS [Introduction to Algorithms 3rd ed](http://ressources.unisciel.fr/algoprog/s00aaroot/aa00module1/res/%5BCormen-AL2011%5DIntroduction_To_Algorithms-A3.pdf). Chapter 12 is on binary trees and chapter 13 is on red-black trees. _Note: I don't know if this pedagogic resources website has the right to publish this book, but it has been up for a long time and has not been taken down. Assume your own reponsibility for using it. The required API is based on this book, which shows pseudocode for all functions._

#### Note
The approaches in the above resources may differ significantly. For example, the Wikipedia article splits different cases into separate functions; the libavl implementation deals with generic nodes and allows duplicates; the implementation supporting the visualization also allows duplicates.

See [Detailed instructions](#detailed-instructions) for the requirements.

## Use of libraries

For this assignment, no external libraries should be used, except for the ANSI C Standard Library. The implementation of the data structures should be your own. We will use library implementations of data structures and programming primitives in the Pintos assignments.

## Coding style

Familiarize yourself with and start the following [coding style guide](http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/c/mike/misc/c_style_guide.html). This ["C Coding Standard"](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~eno/coding/CCodingStandard.html) covers some additional topics as well. 

While you are not expected to follow every point of either, you are expected to develop a consistent C programming style that is as close as possible to the general spirit of both. C code can quickly become [unreadable](http://www.ioccc.org/) and difficult to maintain.

## References

The [C Reference](http://en.cppreference.com/w/c), which you should get confortable consulting.

The [ISO C Standards](http://www.iso-9899.info/wiki/The_Standard) defines the language. A freely available draft [C11 Standard](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf), if you want to dig deep.

This [C98 Library Reference](https://www-s.acm.illinois.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/) seems to be the standard reference. You should not expect many changes, though it's always good to work off a latest copy of your library reference, which should be available through the vendor/implementor.

The following compendia of frequently asked questions about C are excellent resources for the dusty corners, non-sequiturs, and best practices in C programming:

## Detailed instructions

### Input

The input will be a file containing English words, one word per line. **The words are not guaranteed to be lower-case for this assignment, but your counts need to be case-INsensitive.** You need to read it in to sort them. The test file(s) will be in the same directory as your executable and will appear as the first argument when your program is run.

### Output

For each input file `input01.txt`, generate an output file in the same directory, called `myoutput01.txt`. **No ground-truth files will be provided for this assignment. Consider using your code from C PA 1 to generate them.** The output should be an alphabetized list of unique lower-case words and their counts in the file, as follows:

```
one: 4
three: 5
years: 23
```

### Data structures

You should use a **red-black** binary tree to keep the running count for words and keep them in alphabetical order. This means that if you have four words, say *one, two, three, go, one*, that come in this order, you will end up with a tree that looks like:

```
        ["one",2](black)
            /     \
 ["go",1](black)  ["two",1](black)
         /  
 ["three",1](red)
```

Think what traversal you need to print the words in the tree in alphabetical order.

#### Red-black trees

The tree has to be a *self-referential* C `struct`, containing a `color`, a dynamically allocated `word`, its integer `count`, and pointers to the `parent` and `left` and `right` subtrees. In other words, a tree is equivalent to a single node of the tree.

A red-black tree is a _binary_ tree that satisfies the following red-black properties:
1. Every node is either red or black.
2. The root is black.
3. Every leaf (`RB_NULL`) is black.
4. If a node is red, then both its children are black.
5. For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.

#### Sentinel `RB_NULL`
All leaves and the root's parent have to point to a single static sentinel node called `RB_NULL`. It's member's values are immaterial, except that it is **black**. This almost halves the necessary space compared to having a separate `NULL` node for each leaf. It's also better than having raw `NULL` values as pointers to _leaves_ as it makes working with external and internal nodes homogeneous.

You will find the sentinel in the [rb_node.c](rb_node.c) file.

### Functionality

For this assignment, you will have an API in a header file that you need to implement against. The test suite will use this API to test your implementation.

#### Overview 
1. Read words from the file. Don't read in the whole file and then process it. Read it in chunks using a buffer.
2. Tree lookup for the next word in the input. 
3. If a word is in the tree, increment the count; if it isn't, dynamically allocate a new node; position and link it properly, and initialize the count to 1. _**Note:** The red-black properties need to hold between operations!_
4. When you are done with the input, you should have a complete approximately-balanced tree. Use it to print out the output file.
5. Destroy the tree, making sure you `free()` dynamic structures in the proper order.
6. Your tree functions should be *recursive*.

#### Functions
See the [rb_node.h](rb_node.h) header file for details on the API.

1. `struct rb_node *rb_find(const struct rb_node *tree, const struct rb_node *node);`
2. `void rb_left_rotate(const struct rb_node *tree, const struct rb_node *node);`
3. `void rb_right_rotate(const struct rb_node *tree, const struct rb_node *node);`
4. `struct rb_node *rb_insert(const struct rb_node *tree, const struct rb_node *node);`
5. `void rb_restore_after_insert(const struct rb_node *tree, const struct rb_node *node);`
6. `struct rb_node *rb_min(const struct rb_node *tree);`
7. `void rb_transplant(const struct rb_node *tree, struct rb_node *old_root, const struct rb_node *new_root);`
8. `struct rb_node *rb_delete(const struct rb_node *tree, struct rb_node *node);`
9. `void rb_restore_after_delete(const struct rb_node *tree, struct rb_node *orphan);`
